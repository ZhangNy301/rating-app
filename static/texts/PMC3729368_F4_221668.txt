Direct detection of bacterial taxa in PMP tumor tissue by ISH. Hybridizations were carried out as described in the Materials and Methods. Using DNA probes complementary to taxon-specific rRNA sequences, we detected the presence of bacteria in additional patients not included in our sequencing study (patients 196 and 244 shown). Images were selected to show positive hybridization signal with a subset of probes used and are not intended to reflect relative abundance within tissue specimens. FIR, Firmicutes; ACT, Actinobacteria; BET, Betaproteobacteria; VER, Verrucomicrobiales.
