Generation of monoclonal droplets. A diluted solution of bacteria is encapsulated into 75 μm (220 pL) droplets, collected and incubated. In these specific conditions, a single bacterium is present in populated droplets while the rest of the droplets remains empty. This approach alleviates fitness competition between bacteria and maintains complexity of the initial library. Bacteria grew overnight and saturated the droplet volume (red arrows). Scale bar represents 50 μm.
