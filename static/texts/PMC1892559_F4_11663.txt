Immunolocalization of Hic-5 protein in the longitudinal smooth muscle layer of rat myometrium at d15, d17, d19, d21, d22, d23 of gestation and post-partum (PP). On d15 Hic-5 was detectable as distinct, well separated punctate foci at plasma membranes (arrowheads) while at subsequent timepoints, and particularly in PP samples, Hic-5 became consistently detected as an almost continuous line of intense fluorescence at cell membranes (arrows). Control = mouse IgG. Scale bar = 50 Î¼m.
