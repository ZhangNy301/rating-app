 Quantitative analysis for type I collagen positive areas in the glomeruli. Areas immunostained by anti-type I collagen and anti-podoplanin in ten different glomeruli of laser-scanning microscopic images were measured by ImageJ. The relative volume of type I collagen accumulation in the glomeruli was expressed by a mean ratio: area of type I collagen in a glomerulus/area of a glomerulus within podoplanin-positive podocytes. There were statistically significant differences in the relative accumulations of type I collagen in the glomeruli of non-diabetic ICR mice (ICR) and STZ-induced type I diabetic ICR mice (STZ), and between the diabetic mice and the diabetic mice with LPS (STZ+LPS). Data are expressed as means+SD. *Significantly different (p<0.01)
