In situ detection of H2O2 using 3,3′-diaminobenzidine (DAB) staining on rubber tree leaves after treatment with 5 mM SA. The rubber tree leaves were sprayed with either DW as a control or 5 mM SA. Leaf pieces were collected and stained after treatment at different time points (0, 3, 6, 12, 24, 48, 72, 96 and 120 h). Pictures represent three independent biological replicates. The dark brown precipitates indicate the presence and distribution of H2O2 in plant cells, which could be visualized using a light microscope (scale bars = 100 μm).
