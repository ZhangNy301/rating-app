 Analysis of spontaneous tubular motion in vivo. Low magnification incident light image of the mouse testis shows several superficial seminiferous tubule segments, testicular blood vessels (white asterisk; note that unobstructed blood supply (i.e. visualizing erythrocyte flow) is checked routinely), and a specific segment outlined by red dotted lines. After time-lapse imaging, this segment is digitally straightened and subjected to motion analysis. For different time points (i–v), pixel movement and its propagation are reflected by merged pseudocolor images. Directionality is indicated by the black arrow in (CI). From a kymograph (CIII), the time–space relationship of tubular motion becomes apparent (time points i–v as indicated by dashed vertical lines)
