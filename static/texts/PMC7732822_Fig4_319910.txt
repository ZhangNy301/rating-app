 Comparison between the hearing loss group without tinnitus and the control group. In the hearing loss group without tinnitus less gray matter volume was observed in the cingulate cortex (pink), the orbitofrontal cortex (green), and the middle temporal gyri (yellow), depicted on a medial view of the sagittal plane of the right hemisphere. Additional clusters with less gray matter volume, not shown here, were observed in the superior and inferior temporal gyri and the fusiform gyrus (see Table 4). The comparison between the hearing loss group with tinnitus and the controls revealed no significant differences and is therefore not shown in this figure
