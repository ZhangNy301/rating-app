LPL is present in the hippocampal neurons of wild-type mice, as revealed by confocal immunofluorescence microscopy.Sections (10-μm) of brain specimens from wild-type and Lpl–/–MCK-hLPL mice were fixed with 3% PFA and stained with antibodies against LPL (red) and CD31 (green). The left panel shows a tiled low-magnification image recorded with a 20× objective; the right panel shows a single image recorded with a 20× objective. DNA was stained with DAPI (blue). LPL was detected in the hippocampus (note the high density of neurons). LPL was absent from the hippocampus of Lpl–/–MCK-hLPL mice. No LPL was detectable when primary antibodies were omitted. Staining of all tissue sections was performed simultaneously, and images at the same magnification were recorded with the same microscope settings. Two mice per genotype were evaluated; representative images are shown. Scale bar, 50 μm.
