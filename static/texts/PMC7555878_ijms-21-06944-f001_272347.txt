 Actin staining of human osteoblasts on collagen-coated coverslips in unstimulated cells, after electrical stimulation (ES) with 1.4 V cont. and 2.8 V after three and seven days. The 2.8 V group was stimulated 3 × 45 min per day, while the 1.4 V cont. group was stimulated continuously with 1.4 V. The scale measures 50 µm
