Subventricular zone neural progenitor mobilization is increased by oral administration of VCE-003.2. Mice were analyzed 4 weeks after lesion induced by AAV-htt16Q and AAV-htt94Q bilateral injection and daily treatment with vehicle or VCE-003.2 (10 mg/kg). Confocal microscopy characterization of the SVZ was performed with GFAP, htt and Ki-67-specific antibodies in the indicated experimental groups. Proliferating SVZ-neural stem cells were quantified based on GFAP and Ki-67 immunofluorescence colocalization. AAV-htt16Q (Veh and VCE-003.2, n = 7 and 6, respectively) and AAV-htt94Q (Veh and VCE-003.2, n = 7 and 8, respectively). Statistics: One-way ANOVA. F = 5.78; R2 = 0.42. ##p < 0.01; q = 5.29 AAV-htt94Q VCE-003.2 vs. AAV-htt94Q Veh. Scale bar, 100 μm
