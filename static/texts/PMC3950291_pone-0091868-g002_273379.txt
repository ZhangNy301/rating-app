 Cells were untreated or treated with 0.5% 1-ButOH or 5 µg/mL BFA for the indicated times and the Golgi apparatus immunostained for GM-130. With treatment with 1-ButOH, the Golgi apparatus becomes disorganized and the saccules are dilated, while the treatment with BFA resulted in a vesiculation and spreading of the Golgi apparatus. Images are Z-series projections. Bar, 16 µm.
