 Transmission electron micrograph of a COS7 cell stably expressing SEIP-1::Venus protein. The cell was incubated with oleic acid prior to fixation, and stained with diaminobenzidine (DAB), uranyl acetate, and osmium tetroxide prior to electron microscopy. No dark deposits were detected in this negative control. Scale bar = 1 μm.
